Veins of the Earth cave generator and semi-autonomous GM

This is a program created by Jack Toth and Yona Simonson with the intent to automate the process of generating caves/veins for use in the tabletop role playing game Veins of the Earth, such that some players may play the game together without the need for a GM while still having some element of surprise.

Goals:
1: Generate a cave system according to the rules of the VotE book. 
2: Hide information from the players until asked for such that the players can enjoy exploration. 
3: Generate large area maps following the rules of the book. 
4: Provide quick rolls of random generation tables and such.
